Day 1: August 12, 2019

Today's Progress: Created a very crude web page, which shows just how much I need to polish up my HTML & CSS skills. I am also having a wonderful time trying to link it to my live web page :-S

Thoughts: I can get by with cheatsheets, but I won't be happy until I know the coding like the back of my hand. Hence the 100 Days of Code.

Day 2: August 13, 2019

Today's Progress: I copied my original webpage that I created about 3 years ago and created a button bar with 1 live button.
My 1 live button points to the fugly page I made last night.  

Thoughts: I can and will do better. I had an idea in my head, however before I was able to scribble a sketch, my trian of thought derailed.
I came home from work to purple finger and a trip to the urgent center. My kids will always keep me on my toes!

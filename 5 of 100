Day 5: August 65, 2019

Today's Progress: Taking advantage of a half day at work, tonights hour of code started around 6 p.m. and is finally ending after midnight.
I had a cute and comical idea for a website.  So, I created a template from the class I took two years ago and rolled with it.


Thoughts: I had a very inspiring day of coding today.  Tomorrow, I'll make another site and tweek this one a bit.  Check it out and enjoy.

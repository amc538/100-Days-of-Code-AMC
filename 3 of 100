Day 3: August 14, 2019

Today's Progress: I created a table page to track my progress.  Each day, I will link to my work.  

Thoughts: I'm getting there.  I feel like I'm getting the hang of it, but at the same time,
I have a whole lot to learn. On the to-do list for tomorrow:  the start of a blog and home buttons :-)

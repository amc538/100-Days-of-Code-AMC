Day 9: August 21, 2019

Today's Progress: I fixed my images & they still won't work. Syntax looks ok, but they're not working.
I'll have to look at how the directories are setup on the server. It looks great until I upload. 

Thoughts: Just a little frustrated with broken links.  I'll fix them tomorrow.
